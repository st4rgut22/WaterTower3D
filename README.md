# WaterTower3D

A Unity3d strategy game: http://ec2-18-220-1-209.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/

Game Objective: 
The objective is simple: make it out of the tower without being beaten to death or drowning in lava. You have your minions to help build your tower. Each is a unique individual with personality traits that make them disposed to fight or farm. YOU are the player in the center. You can click on your followers to view their personality traits. Reward followers with positive traits and they will work harder for you. Clicking on their square will elevate their towers. Beware, once a follower drowns, he will turn into a bloodsucking demon intent on revenge.
